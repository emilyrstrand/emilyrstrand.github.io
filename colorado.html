			<p> Colorado is a great place to visit and see the Rocky Mountains. Its closer in distance to Wisconsin and there are cheap places to camp or stay at. Emily went on her Colorado roadtrip with her freshman year roommates. It is a fun vacation they talk about to this day! <b>Gem Lake </b> was Emily's favorite hike in the Rocky Mountain National Park. </p>
